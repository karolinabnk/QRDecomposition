# QRDecomposition

A java application for finding QR factorization of a given matrix. Can be used to decompose any real square matrix into a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix. 
Elements of the matrix can be given by just typing them in the app window or by submiting a text file (then the result will also be a text file).
